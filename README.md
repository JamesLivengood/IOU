# I O U - U O M E, a splitwise.com clone

## I O U - U O M E is a bill sharing app. Users can add friends, post bills they paid, and specify exactly how much each person owes. It creates a dynamic chart of all the user's bills, how much the user owes / is owed total, and how much the user owes to each of their friends. Users can then record full, or incremental payments on their bills.
